                    Hi, everyone ,<br/>
                    this is Yasaman Arabgard . I'm a 22 years old front-end developer with a curious mind in programming ;
                    I'm interested in programming and coding since I did my first 'Hello World' at university.<br />
                    I like to do challenges in my code cause I belive that it makes progress in my skills and then in my code!<br />
                    I'd like to code individualy and team work both! but at the end in my mind no one can't failure a strong team.<br />
                    after all programming helped me when I was feeling down in my life and now it's every thing to me ; I try to become better
                    more and more every day.<br />
                    hope you enjoy my project.
                </p>
